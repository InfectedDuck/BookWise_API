# Bookshop Express Application

## Overview
The project leverages Express server to seamlessly incorporate CRUD functionalities via HTTP methods, tested efficiently with Postman. Emphasizing security, Session and JWT authentication are integrated to exclusively permit authenticated users for specific operations. The code is optimized through the adoption of Promises, Callbacks, or Async/Await functions, facilitating concurrent interactions by multiple users without dependencies on each other's operations.

## Features

- Retrieve a list of all books available in the bookshop
- Search for specific books and retrieve their details based on the bookâ€™s ISBN code, author names and titles
- Retrieve reviews/comments for specified books
- Register as a new user of the application
- Login to the application
- Add a new review for a book (logged in users only)
- Modify a book review (logged in users can modify only their own reviews)
- Delete a book review (logged in users can delete only their own reviews)
- (Multiple users) Access the application at the same time to view and manage different book reviews simultaneously
